// BrainRunner is the Kernel-side abstraction that launches and stops brain

// (fork/exec, IPC, or in-process), perform the initialize handshake defined
// in 20-协议规格.md §5, and return an agent.Agent handle.
//
// See 02-BrainKernel设计.md §12.5 for the runner decisions (sidecar topology,
// LLM access modes, credential passing).

	// the runner may use it as a sanity check on the handshake response.

	// events before being killed.
