// Turn is a single iteration of the Agent Loop: assemble a ChatRequest,
// invoke llm.Provider, dispatch any returned tool calls, update the Budget,
// and decide the next Run.State. Every Turn is persisted (see
// persistence.PlanStore) so that a resumed host process can replay the Run
// deterministically using the UUID field as the idempotency key.
// See 22-Agent-Loop规格.md §6.

	// UUID is a globally unique idempotency key generated before the
	// LLM call and persisted before any external side effect. On resume
	// the Runner MUST reject a duplicate Turn with the same UUID, so
	// partial crashes cannot cause double-billing or double-tool-call.
	// See 22-Agent-Loop规格.md §6.1 and §12.
	UUID string

	// StartedAt is the wall-clock timestamp when the Turn began
	// assembling its ChatRequest. See 22-Agent-Loop规格.md §6.1.

// Executor is the abstraction that drives a single Turn to completion. A
// concrete Executor is responsible for assembling the final ChatRequest
// (including CachePoint layers and RemainingBudget), invoking the
// llm.Provider, dispatching tool calls, and producing a TurnResult. The
// Agent Loop Runner owns the Run-level State machine and delegates each
// Turn to an Executor. See 22-Agent-Loop规格.md §6.2.

// *brainerrors.BrainError when the Turn failed. See 22-Agent-Loop规格.md §6.3.
